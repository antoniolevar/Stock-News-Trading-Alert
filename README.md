Stock News Alert Project
This project is a Python-based script that monitors stock price changes and sends alerts with relevant news articles using the Twilio API. When a stock price increases or decreases by a defined percentage threshold, the program fetches recent news related to the stock and sends alerts via SMS.

Project Overview
The script performs the following actions:

Stock Price Monitoring: Using the Alpha Vantage API, the program retrieves the latest daily closing stock prices for a specified stock.
Percentage Change Calculation: If there is a significant price change (greater than the defined threshold), the program triggers a news search.
News Retrieval: Using the News API, the script fetches relevant news articles related to the stock's company.
SMS Notification: The program sends SMS alerts with the article titles and descriptions using the Twilio API.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Twilio Account for SMS capabilities. Set up your Twilio SID and Auth Token.
Alpha Vantage API Key for retrieving stock prices.
News API Key for fetching the latest news articles.
